In this example, :End is a text string known as a label. The batch file first prompts the user to insert a floppy disk in drive
A:. The user would insert the disk and press the Enter key. If the Chkdsk command runs successfully, the Goto
command transfers control to the line identified by the :End label and the program ends. Otherwise, 
an error message is displayed


@Echo off
Echo Please insert a disk in drive A
Pause
Chkdsk A: /f
If not errorlevel 1 goto End
Echo An error occurred while performing disk check.
:End

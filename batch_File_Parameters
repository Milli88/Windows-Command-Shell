Batch File Parameters
-----------------------------------
You use parameters in batch files to get information about environment settings. 
These parameters are denoted by the expansion variables %0 through %9. The %0 variable is 
replaced with the name of the batch file currently being processed. You can specify other variables from %1 to %9 
inside the batch file using argument types at the command prompt. For example, if you have two folders named Folder1 and Folder2, 
and you want to copy all the files and subfolders in C:\Folder1 to D:\Folder2, you would use the following command at the command 
prompt:
-------------------------------------
Xcopy C:\Folder1\*.* D:\Folder2
Using batch file parameters, you would create a batch file named Mybatch.bat and include the following command:

Xcopy %1\*.* %2
Save the file and run the following command from the command prompt:

Mybatch1.bat C:\Folder1 D:\Folder2
In this command, the variable %1 refers to C:\Folder1 and the variable %2 refers to D:\Folder2. When the command is run, 
all the files and folders from C:\Folder1 will be copied to D:\Folder2.

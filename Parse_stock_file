Letâ€™s consider an example from the stock file of an electronics store. 
This file is a text file named Stock.txt that contains the name of the items, 
their part number, the number currently in stock, their reorder level, and the total number sold. 
The first line of this file reads as follows:

Calculators    CA5600125    75    15    45
You can parse the file using the For command as follows:

For /F "tokens=1-5" %%A in (stock.txt) do )@echo Item: %%A Part Number: %%B In Stock: %%C Reorder: %%D Sold: %%E)
